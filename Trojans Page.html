            <h2>What is a Trojan?</h2>
            <p>
                A Trojan, also known as a Trojan horse, is a type of malicious software (malware) that pretends to be legitimate software or files to trick users into installing it. Named after the famous Greek myth of the Trojan Horse, the malware is disguised as a harmless program but secretly contains malicious payloads. 
                Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not self-replicate; instead, they rely on user actions to spread. Typically, Trojans can be delivered through email attachments, infected software downloads, or malicious websites.

            <h2>How Does a Trojan Work?</h2>
            <p>
                The primary method of infection for Trojans is social engineering, wherein the attacker manipulates the victim into executing the malware. Once the Trojan is installed, it operates stealthily in the background, often without the victim’s knowledge. 
                Trojans can perform a variety of malicious activities depending on their design. Some Trojans exploit vulnerabilities in the system or programs to gain elevated access to the system. They can act as backdoors, enabling attackers to take control of the system remotely. Others may log keystrokes, monitor user activity, or steal sensitive data such as passwords and financial information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key feature of Trojans is that they do not self-replicate. Unlike viruses or worms, a Trojan needs the victim’s participation, whether it's by opening an attachment, downloading a file, or visiting a compromised website. Trojans often rely on exploiting a user’s trust, making them one of the most successful forms of malware.

            <h2>What Does a Trojan Do?</h2>
            <p>
                A Trojan can perform a wide range of malicious activities depending on its purpose and design. Some common functions of Trojans include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remote Access:</strong> Many Trojans function as backdoors, allowing attackers to remotely control the infected system, bypass firewalls, and steal sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Theft:</strong> Trojans can harvest sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, or banking information and send it back to the attacker.</li>
                <li><strong>System Hijacking:</strong> Some Trojans can take control of a system and make it part of a botnet, enabling the attacker to use the system for launching further attacks or spamming.</li>
                <li><strong>Payload Delivery:</strong> Trojans can act as delivery mechanisms for other types of malware, such as ransomware, spyware, or keyloggers. This makes them an important tool for cybercriminals to distribute malicious software without detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware and Surveillance:</strong> Some Trojans are designed to spy on user activities, capture screenshots, record keystrokes, or even activate cameras and microphones on the victim’s computer without their knowledge.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Detect Trojans</h2>
            <p>
                Detecting Trojans can be difficult because they often operate in the background without showing obvious symptoms. However, there are signs to look out for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unusual system behavior:</strong> Sluggish performance, crashes, or strange errors may indicate the presence of a Trojan.</li>
                <li><strong>Unexpected network traffic:</strong> A Trojan may send data from the infected machine to a remote attacker, so increased network activity could be a clue.</li>
                <li><strong>Suspicious files or processes:</strong> Task manager or antivirus software may show unfamiliar or suspicious processes running in the background.</li>
                <li><strong>Disabled security software:</strong> Trojans may disable or interfere with antivirus software and firewalls to avoid detection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Prevent Trojan Infections</h2>
            <p>
                Preventing Trojan infections involves a combination of user vigilance and robust security practices. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be cautious with email attachments and downloads:</strong> Avoid opening email attachments from unknown senders, and ensure that software is downloaded from trusted sources only.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep your software up to date:</strong> Regularly update your operating system, antivirus software, and all applications to patch known vulnerabilities that Trojans can exploit.</li>
                <li><strong>Use strong, unique passwords:</strong> Protect your accounts with strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Run regular antivirus scans:</strong> Use reputable antivirus programs to scan your system for Trojans and other types of malware regularly.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable firewalls:</strong> A firewall can block malicious traffic and prevent unauthorized access to your system, reducing the risk of Trojan infections.</li>
            </ul>
