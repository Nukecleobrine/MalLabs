            <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
            <p>Malware is malicious software that can do a variety of things to the target system. It can be designed to steal passwords and information, slow or crash systems, grant access hackers access to your device, spy on what you're doing and many more  . The term "malware" is a broad term that covers different forms of malicious software, such as viruses, worms, and trojans.</p>

            <h3>History of Malware</h3>
            <p>Malware has been around since the early days of computing. The first virus, the "Creeper virus," appeared in the early 1970s. Over time, malware evolved with advancements in technology, becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. In the 1980s, the first computer worms appeared, and by the late 1990s, viruses began spreading through email. As the internet expanded, so did the ways malware could be delivered.</p>

            <h3>Common Myths and Misconceptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Only Windows is vulnerable to malware. <br><strong>Fact:</strong> Malware affects all operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and mobile devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Macs are immune to malware. <br><strong>Fact:</strong> Macs can and do get malware, although it's less common than on Windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Antivirus software is enough to protect you. <br><strong>Fact:</strong> While antivirus software is important, it's not foolproof. Safe browsing practices and updates are key to prevention.</li>

            <h2>What Does Malware Do?</h2>
            <p>Malware can cause a wide variety of problems, ranging from minor annoyances to serious security breaches. Here's how it can affect systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steals Personal Information:</strong> Malware can collect sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, and bank information.</li>
                <li><strong>Disrupts System Performance:</strong> Some malware slows down your computer by creating large mounts of files, using system recources and bypassing system restrictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Encrypts Files (Ransomware):</strong> Ransomware locks your files (or just copies them to spread over the internet) and demands payment for their release .</li>
                <li><strong>Spies on User Activity (Spyware):</strong> Spyware tracks what you are doing, it can capture video, audio, browsing habits and keystrokes.</li>
                <li><strong>Spreads to Other Devices/Networks:</strong> Malware often spreads from one device to another (worms), causing widespread infections and damage in networks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="how-malware-works">
            <h2>How Does Malware Work?</h2>
            <p>Malware can use multiple methods to enter and gain control in your devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infection Methods:</strong> Malware can be spread via email, infected files, connecting to infected websites, social media and exploting system weaknesses. USB drives can also carry malware.</li>
                <li><strong>How it Hides:</strong> Rootkits allow malware to change and adapt itself to stay hidden from the system or antivirus software.</li>
                <li><strong>How it Spreads:</strong> Malware can spread over a network (worms) and can be spread via botnets. Botnets are a group of infected devices controlled by a hacker, they can be used to spread malware to the contacts on the device or for other purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>How it Executes:</strong> Malware often exploits system vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges and then run in the background without the user's knowledge.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="types-of-malware">
            <h2>Types of Malware</h2>
            <p>There are many types of malware, each with different objectives and behaviors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Self-replicating programs that attach to files and spread when the infected file is executed.</li>
                <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Malware that spreads without needing a host file, often exploiting network vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Disguised as legitimate software, Trojans trick users into installing them.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files and demands a ransom for their release.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly monitors user activity, collecting sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Delivers unwanted ads and collects user data for targeted advertising.</li>
                <li><strong>Rootkits:</strong> Deeply embedded malware designed to avoid detection and take control of a system.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyloggers:</strong> Records keystrokes to capture sensitive information like passwords.</li>
            </ul>
